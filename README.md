# GoM-Fish-and-Inv-Occupancy-1
Occupany analysis of fish and invertebrate data collected with bag seine (Communications Biology). 

The codes conduct occupancy analysis of bag seine data. The data were collected from 1982 to 2016 at 8 major bays along Texas coast by TWPD. The row data are available from  

Fujiwara, M., Martinez-Andrade, F. (2019) Bag Seine Catch Data in Bays along the Texas Coast from 1982 to 2016. Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO). Dataset version 2019-07-15. doi:10.1575/1912/bco-dmo.773137.1 

The codes were created under MATLAB 2018a with Optimization Toolbox (fminunc.m is required). 

The data used are saved in BagSeine.mat.
"analysisMainV2.m" conduct occupancy analysis with observation probability with random effect.
"analsyisMainV2F.m" conduct occupancy analysis with constant observation probability.
